# Studio Laska – Wedding Agency Landing Page

This project is my first major evaluation after several months of studying web development. I built a responsive landing page for a fictional wedding agency called "Studio Laska."

## 🎯 Project Goal
The main objective was to test my knowledge and see how confidently I could build a structured layout from scratch. This project simulates working with a designer—translating a visual concept into clean, functional code.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **HTML5:** Semantic markup for better accessibility.
* **CSS (SCSS):** Modular styles for easier maintenance.
* **Flexbox:** Used for overall layout and precise alignment.
* **Responsive Design:** Ensuring the site looks great on both mobile and desktop screens.

## 🚀 Key Features
* **Adaptive Layout:** Fully functional on devices from 360px up to wide desktops.
* **Service Sections:** Clearly structured blocks showing the agency's offers.
* **Contact Form:** A custom-styled form for user inquiries.
* **Google Maps:** Integrated map showing the studio location.

## 📱 Practice Experience
This was a great lesson in:
1. Managing complex layouts with Flexbox.
2. Organizing files using the SCSS structure.
3. Solving real-world responsive design challenges.
